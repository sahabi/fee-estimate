# Purpose

Vision: Provide a platform where developers can easily develop fee estimation algorithm for bitcoin network.

# Phase-1 Objective

The goal by the end of phase 1 is to have a user interface where the user can try out and analyze different parameters in the available fee estimators: 0.14 and 0.15 implementations.

# Phase-1 Plan
